    Generate an AI-style response based on the input question.

    This function simulates an asynchronous operation that takes in a user's question

    calling an external LLM API or a custom AI model.

    Args:
        request (AIRequest): A data model containing the user's question.

    Returns:
        AIResponse: A response model containing the generated (placeholder) answer.
